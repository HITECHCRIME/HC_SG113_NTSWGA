```
aye aye ya
mothnode
net swagga
fucker

caught in the net so slow - uu          
ya cannot reach them heights - ya (down)     
caught in the net so slow - uu          
better watch from afar        
(can't right the wrong)

caught in the net so slow - uu         
ya cannot reach them heights - ya (down)       
caught in the net so slow - uu          
better watch from afar (more melody to the end)                  

better swap ya handle to naught
better swap it before 
getting ahold of the switch ya (can't right the wrong)
plug it bitch
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
caught in the net so slow - uu
ya cannot reach them heights - ya       
caught in the net so slow - uu          
better watch from afar     

better swap ya handle to naught
better swap it before 
getting ahold of the switch ya
plug it bitch

blowing them chances to fold - uu
prep for a breach - wait what 
withhold the vital data - uu 
don’t give to witch - uu

most of the days just drifting me up - so 
slide off the scales - now
can’t believe what i’m - saying
if you really turn up i'm done 7

maybe i should tough it out - you
once said dust goes down - uu
x?
now i doubt it will ever happen blood

caught in the net so slow - uu          
ya cannot reach them heights - ya (down)     
caught in the net so slow - uu          
better watch from afar                 

caught in the net so slow - uu         
ya cannot reach them heights - ya (down)       
caught in the net so slow - uu          
better watch from afar                   

better swap ya handle to naught
better swap it before 
getting ahold of the switch ya
plug it bitch
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
caught in the net so slow - uu  /// everyday counting up checks - uu
ya cannot reach them heights - ya       /// yeah young nigga up next - uu
caught in the net so slow - uu          /// everyday counting up checks - uu
better watch from afar     /// better give me respect 

blame for thirst - old dychotomy 8
sordid blatant hypocrisy shown

soooometimes i get things right
even if involves
losses some abound

all my thoughts used to roll with the tide
fall with emotions, rationals, lost in the pride
so strong can’t deny
it’s the price of honour
to stand tall but withdraw

everyday counting up checks - uu -          / caught in the net so slow - uu

yeah young nigga up next - uu                  / 

everyday counting up checks - ha            /

better give me respect

everyday counting up checks - uu

yeah young nigga up next - uu

everyday counting up checks - ha

better give me respect

count it up 

count it up 

count it up

count it up 

count it up 

count it up 

count it up

aye

everyday counting up checks - uu

yeah young nigga up next - uu

everyday counting up checks - ha

better give me respect

counting up check i'm rich

i sold crack when i was six - six

lil pump ain't no snitch - nah

sold your grandma two bricks - but two

bitch nigga  say it with you chest

louie v. on my vest - what

your bitcch got nice breasts - yo

think i might fuck her on a jet - fool

everyday having fun drinking lean

xanex percocet even promethazine - uu

everyday fuck with a new bitch

chinese, japanese if they in magazine

gucci gang bands don't stop

riding in a big ass yacht

jacket on, man's not hot - hot

gave my mom two glocks

count it up

count it up

count it up

count it

niggas talk big but they not really bout it

niggas talk money but they not really trapping

niggas talk cars i just copped a new audi

you niggas lazy that jewelery fugazee

your girlfriend amaze me i gave her a baby

came from the south so my niggas are crazy

she foam from her mouth and i think she got rabies


OLD LYRICS
caught in the net so slow 
ya can’t reach them heights from afar 
get ahold of the switch
blowing chances to fold
prep for a breach and withholding all the data
don’t give it to the witch
most of the days just drifting me up so 7 + 1
slide the damn scale, can’t believe what i’m saying
 if you really turn up 7
maybe i should tough it out once 
you said dust goes down 7
now i doubt it will ever happen blood 7
blame for thirst - old dychotomy 8
sordid blatant hypocrisy shown
soooometimes i get things right
even if involves 
losses some abound
all my thoughts used to roll with the tide
fall with emotions, rationals, lost in the pride
so strong can’t deny 
 it’s the price of honour
 to stand tall but withdraw
