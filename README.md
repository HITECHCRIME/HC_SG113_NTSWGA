caught in the net so slow - uu          
i cannot reach them heights - ya (down)     
caught in the net so slow - a          
better watch from afar        

caught in the net so slow - u        
i cannot reach them heights - ya (down)       
caught in the net so slow - u          
better watch (works) from afar (more melody to the end)  

better swap ya handle to naught
better swap it before
getting ahold of the switch ya 
plug it bitch, can't right the wrong

net so slow, net so slow
net so slow, net so slow  ////// here comes the low guttural growl in the background
net so slow 

caught in the net so slow - uu

ya cannot reach them heights - ya   

caught in the net so slow - uu   

better watch from afar     

better swap ya handle to naught
better swap it before
getting ahold of the switch ya

plug it bitch

blowing them chances to fold yeah              /// here goes a gritty low voice
prep for a breach - wait what                  /// here goes a gritty low voice
withhold the vital data (vital organs - uu)    /// here goes a gritty low voice
don’t give them to witch - uu
most of the days just drifting me up - so 
slide off the scales - now (i can't believe in da-ta)
can’t believe in my data, just sayin'             (can’t believe what i’m - saying)
if you really turn up i'm done (i'm already dead - now)
(if it -really- turns out i'm -already- dead - now
(if it fuckin' turns out i'm already dead - now
now
now now
maybe i should tough it out - you
once said dust goes down - uu (how past goes down)
now i doubt it will ever happen blood
x? with everything that's been going on?
(happen blood - scream)

now write it down

caught in the net so slow - uu          
i cannot reach them heights - ya (down)     
caught in the net so slow - uu          
better watch from afar                 

caught in the net so slow - uu         
i cannot reach them heights - ya (down)       
caught in the net so slow - uu          
better watch from afar                   

better swap ya handle to naught
better swap it before 
getting ahold of the switch ya
plug it bitch
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
net so slow
caught in the net so slow - uu          /// everyday counting up checks - uu
ya cannot reach them heights - ya       /// yeah young nigga up next - uu
caught in the net so slow - uu          /// everyday counting up checks - uu
better watch from afar                  /// better give me respect 

blame for thirst - old dychotomy 8
sordid blatant hypocrisy shown

soooometimes i get things right
even if involves
losses some abound

from roots to the top 
that's the promise abound
BRUJAS were RIGHT 'BOUT one thing 
MILLION OF FAILURES TO WIN YEAH

AND EVEN IF I WIN WHAT'S IN MY HEART
EVEN ALONE IT'LL HOLD SYNERGY in (ITS) CORE
IT'S ONLY FOR ME AS OTHERS ARE APART
FROM MY THOUGHTS FROM MY STRATAS
I GO CRAZY FROM


all my thoughts used to roll with the tide
fall with emotions, rationals, lost in the pride
so strong can’t deny
it’s the price of honour
to stand tall but withdraw
red is the color of our squad

ooh shit that's a hitech crime

everyday counting up checks - uu -          / caught in the net so slow - uu

yeah young nigga up next - uu                  / 

everyday counting up checks - ha            /

better give me respect

everyday counting up checks - uu

yeah young nigga up next - uu

everyday counting up checks - ha

better give me respect

count it up 

count it up 

count it up

count it up 

count it up 

count it up

everyday counting up checks - uu

yeah young nigga up next - uu

everyday counting up checks - ha

better give me respect

lil pump ain't no snitch - nah

sold your grandma two bricks - but two

bitch nigga  say it with you chest

louie v. on my vest - what

your bitcch got nice breasts - yo

think i might fuck her on a jet - fool

everyday having fun drinking lean

xanex percocet even promethazine - uu

everyday fuck with a new bitch

chinese, japanese if they in magazine

gucci gang bands don't stop

riding in a big ass yacht

jacket on, man's not hot - hot

gave my mom two glocks

count it up

count it up

count it

niggas talk big but they not really bout it

niggas talk money but they not really trapping

niggas talk cars i just copped a new audi

you niggas lazy that jewelery fugazee

your girlfriend amaze me i gave her a baby

came from the south so my niggas are crazy

she foam from her mouth and i think she got rabies


OLD LYRICS
caught in the net so slow 
ya can’t reach them heights from afar 
get ahold of the switch
blowing chances to fold
prep for a breach and withholding all the data
don’t give it to the witch
most of the days just drifting me up so 7 + 1
slide the damn scale, can’t believe what i’m saying
 if you really turn up 7
maybe i should tough it out once 
you said dust goes down 7
now i doubt it will ever happen blood 7
blame for thirst - old dychotomy 8
sordid blatant hypocrisy shown
soooometimes i get things right
even if involves 
losses some abound
all my thoughts used to roll with the tide
fall with emotions, rationals, lost in the pride
so strong can’t deny 
 it’s the price of honour
 to stand tall but withdraw

## Notes

## Music Video

Greyhooded figure in a square black room, slowmo mixed with mid velocity stabilized Osmo Pocket footage, strobe LitraTorches with colors flashing. Rotating circles with the LitraTorches on floor and ceiling (symmetrical). Sort of opening a portal.
Quick cuts between the same room empty with strobe light (signifies the urges and constant dynamic thought) and crowded with lots of smoke and lasers with kind of stable light (represents grounding among the tribe).

Commentary on bandwidth throttling and internet scarcity.
Caught in a bad relationship and controlling personalities.
